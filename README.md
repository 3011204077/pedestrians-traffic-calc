pedestrians-traffic-calc
========================

Created during #douhack 2013 in Donetsk.

See demo for this here:
http://youtu.be/gcONLfkFSNM

Application is created with OpenCV library (for Java) and Processign framework.

It contains a lot of hacks and there is much to improve.

Next things author want's to check:

1. Use and improve camshift algorithm for object tracking.
2. Remove noise with checking speev of moved objects.
3. Play with different trackign algorithms (including BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 which is ported to OpenCV 3, I guess)
4. Play with "segmentMotion" and "calcGlobalOrientation" to identify moved pieces more carefully.

Please, contact myself at mgalushka [@at] gmail dot [com] if you are interested in this project and want to learn OpenCV and object recognition techniquest with me.

Big thanks to #douhack and Binary studio in Donetsh for hosting this event!
